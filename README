AssistantBase:

To use: 

1. put AssistantBase.js into your app/models folder.
2. In sources.json, add: {"source": "app/models/AssistantBase.js"}
3. When adding an assistant, create your assistant class as follows:

var YourAssistant = Class.create(AssistantBase, {})

where the data in the hash is the class's functions and member variables. For more information on Prototype's Class.create() function, see http://www.prototypejs.org/api/class/create .

As a heads up, if you do want to override setup, cleanup, or deactivate, add $super as the first parameter for those functions, then call $super() as the first line.
